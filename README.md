# Roommate-Finder

# Problem
The real problem is that current residents can't easily find compatible people to share their space with. Let's say I have a spare room - I want to find someone who matches my lifestyle and preferences, but current platforms don't make this easy. Students and young professionals especially struggle with this. They either end up posting on random social media groups or using property listing sites that aren't designed for roommate matching.
We want to solve this roommate finding challenge by creating a dedicated platform where current residents can directly connect with people looking for rooms where you can share your living preferences, lifestyle, and available space directly with potential roommates, without going through landlords or real estate agents. This would make the whole process more personal, secured, efficient, and better suited to building compatible living arrangements.

# Idea
Developed a JavaFX-based platform called Roommate Finder, designed for individuals seeking to fill open spaces in their existing shared accommodations. This platform will allow users to list available spots and search for potential roommates based on specific criteria.
The platform will provide detailed information about the existing household, including accommodation type, cost breakdown, and utilities.
